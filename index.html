    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <img src = "./images/DSC07903_Original.jpg" alt="Picture of Lea Wiranatha at her graduation" height = 200 />
    <p>I am Lea Christy Yang Wiranatha, a motivated and dedicated individual pursuing 
        a major in Computer Science at California Polytechnic State University. 
        With a strong academic background and a GPA of 3.76/4.0, I have developed proficiency 
        in Python, Java, and Google Drive. During my internship at United Pacific Bank, I 
        honed my attention to detail and customer service skills while verifying financial 
        records and supporting the operations department. Alongside my studies, I actively 
        participated in extracurricular activities, such as being a member of the Walnut High 
        School Girls Golf Team, engaging in community service through Key Club, and volunteering 
        at City Blessing Church. I also had the opportunity to participate in the Girls Who 
        Code Summer Program, where I gained foundational coding knowledge and collaborated 
        effectively with like-minded peers. With a passion for video games, music, embroidery, 
        and TikTok, I bring a diverse range of skills and experiences to contribute to a dynamic 
        organization while continuously learning and growing.</p>
